# Flight-Price-Prediction
This project aims to predict ticket prices for upcoming flights to help 
customers in selecting the optimum time for travel and the cheapest 
flight to the desired destination. A random forest regression model is 
applied to forecast the flight prices based on data scraped from Kaggle.
The varying prices of airline ticket has always kept the consumer 
confused, it is a challenging task as various practices are used by the 
industry to increase their revenue .The consumers being uncertain 
about the change in price fall prey to these and land up buying high 
priced tickets. Indian aviation industry states that it is on high-growth 
trajectory. It aims to becomes third largest aviation market by 2020 and 
the largest by 2030, according to Directorate General of Civil Aviation 
domestic air traffic has growth at the rate of 22 per cent, International 
passenger traffic at 8.53 per cent by the report of February 2017 8.23 
million passengers have flown domestic. "Cheap Air Tickets" is most 
searched term in India in sector of aviation industry. Due to increase in 
number of domestic passengers, consumers hunting for cheap priced air 
tickets have increased .Hence, the proposed research is basically 
machine learning and statistic intensive. We used Python & Java for the 
implementation of the models & automation.
Objective of this Project is to compare price of different machine
learning techniques in predicting the trend of next-day flight price 
(whether the price would increase or decrease) for selected ourney.. 
Our model uses robust machine learning techniqueslike Neural 
Network, Logistical Regression, Random Forest,Decision Tree and
Support Vector Machine algorithms to predict the next-day price.
